A simple automation that connects to the [Ebeco Connect API](https://www.ebeco.com/guidance/guides/ebeco-open-api) and Vattenfall electricity price API and allows you to turn off your floor heating when the price is too high.

Uses code from https://github.com/dhutchison/homebridge-ebeco

## Example

Example of running this application via the [Docker image](https://github.com/khromov/ebeco-electricity-price-automation/pkgs/container/ebeco-electricity-price-automation%2Febeco-electricity-price-automation). The logic runs on a hourly schedule.
